By Olukayode Babalola The National Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, has declared support for the re-election of Gov.

He said giving the governor another term would afford him the opportunity to complete the unfinished works he had embarked on in his first tenure. Adamu who was formerly the Senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone before emerging as APC National Chairman, explained that voting Sule who hails from Nasarawa North Senatorial Zone would ensure fairness and equity to complete his second term before the baton of power is passed to another zone. “There is no one else we should be voting for except Gov. Sule, so he can come back and complete his remaining four years’ tenure before we vote in someone else. “Now the election has been shifted to March 18. In spite of this, there is no rest till we complete the exercise and Gov. Sule is pronounced as winner and Governor-elect,” he said. He urged the governor’s supporters to continue to conduct themselves in an orderly manner and avoid actions that would break the law. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678394501578-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68580" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678394501578-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678394501578-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678394501578.jpg 471w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> Alhaji Aliyu Tijjani, Organiser of the rally and Chairman, United West Zone for Abdullahi Sule Re-election, told newsmen that the rally was in fulfilment of a pledge made in the past that no politician from Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone would contest against the governor in 2023. He said that stakeholders in the zone had also pledged to give the governor maximum support with regards to his re-election bid, hence the grand rally to galvanise support among the people of Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone. “Today we decided to organise this rally to officially inform his Excellency that we are with him and will give him our maximum support,” Tijjani said. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678385120773-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68582" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678385120773-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678385120773-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/FB_IMG_1678385120773.jpg 941w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> An APC chieftain from the zone, Labaran Magaji, said the unity exhibited by the people of the Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone irrespective of their differences in terms of religion, tribe, politics and any other sentiments was due to the sterling performance of the governor. “We have made our resolve to vote massively for Gov. Sule to return to office and continue the good works he has been doing. “Speculations about disunity in the APC in the Western zone are not real because we are all united. We are people with one voice,” he said.. The Executive Chairman of Nasarawa Local Government Area, Mr Mohammed Salihu, also commended Gov. Sule for the stability in the security of the state. “Again there is stability in the polity of Nasarawa State under Gov. Sule. As you can see in the last election, all the parties were given a free hand to operate. “I have no doubt that Gov. Sule is coming for the second term,” Salihu said.
