By Muhyideen Jimoh The Association of Women Town Planners in Nigeria (AWTPN), has called for gender equity and focus on girl-child education as the nation celebrates the 2023 International Women’s Day celebration. Mrs Bukola Bello, AWTPN Chairperson, made the call on Wednesday, in Abuja at an event by the association to commemorate the Day. “This year’s International Women’s Day presents an opportunity to celebrate, discuss and embrace Equity: ‘equal opportunities are no longer enough but Equity should be the order of the day’. “There is also the need to engage more women in governance and administrations as well as to empower and invest in the girl-child with a view to achieving equality and equity in all directions for a better society,” she said. Bello specifically called for the implementation of the 35 per cent affirmative action for gender inclusion in all states and the Federation. She said the association would continue to lead the campaign of catching the girl-child young through frequent sensitisation programmes in secondary schools. Earlier, Mrs Oluwayinka Bello, Chairperson AWTPN, FCT chapter, said the Day was meant to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievement of women to nation building. “This celebration (marked on March 8) is another call to power on efforts to make the digital world safer, more inclusive, more equitable and create a better future not just for women and girls but for all humanity,” she said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the International Women’s Day is celebrated annually on March 8 in honour of women’s achievements, raises awareness about discrimination and takes action to drive gender parity. This year’s celebration has the theme “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Vincent Obi
