By Ruth Oketunde Mr Mustapha Ahmed, the Director-General, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has appreciated the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) for its continuous donation to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the country. He expressed the appreciation when he received a team from the KSrelief centre on Thursday in Abuja. Ahmed, who commended the humanitarian agency for announcing its plans to provide further relief donations to the IDPs in Borno, Yobe and Kano State, lauded the centre for its past support to IDPs in Borno, Yobe and Zamfara. He said that the gesture was an evidence of friendship and brotherhood between Nigeria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The director-general assured that NEMA would continue to ensure proper distribution of the relief items meant for the target beneficiaries, especially those affected by disasters in the country. He, however, appealed that the centre extended its support to the country, especially to those impacted by the 2022 flood disaster which ravaged many communities. Also speaking, Hajiya Fatima Kasim, Director, Planning, Research and Forecasting in the Agency, said that a total of 7,750 households had been profiled to benefit from the lastest food donation from the centre. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the KSrelief team was led by Mr Basheer Saleem. NAN reports that King Salman bin Abdulaziz established KSrelief in 2015. The centre is in the framework of the Saudiâ€™s efforts to alleviate the suffering of those in need worldwide. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Kevin Okunzuwa/Sadiya Hamza
