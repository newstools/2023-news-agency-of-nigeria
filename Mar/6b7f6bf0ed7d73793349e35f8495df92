By Deji Abdulwahab The Concerned All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders in Nasarawa State have called on Gov. Abdullahi Sule to avoid a divided house before the Saturday March 11 election. The Convener of the group, Mr Dominic Alancha, gave the advice on Saturday at a news conference in Abuja. Alancha said that defeat of APC in the presidential and National Assembly elections in the state was orchestrated by internal wrangling, especially from the aggrieved state government functionaries. According to him, most of them are APC government appointees who worked against the party and were also planning to work against the party in the Governorship and State House of Assembly elections. “The onus is on the governor to do the needful before we go into the election comes March 11, or else, we will go into it as a divided house. “We, therefore, say that the Governorship and House of Assembly elections slated for March 11 should be different. “We are calling on all concerns to come out and address the issues that could affect the victory of APC in the March 11 election in Nasarawa State. `We believe that Gov. Abdullahi Sule is one of the Governors considered to have done well and given the dividends of democracy,’’ group’s convener said. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) ADA/GOK Edited by Olagoke Olatoye ===========
