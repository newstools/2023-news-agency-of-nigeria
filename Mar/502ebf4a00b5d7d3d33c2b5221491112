By Kingsley Okoye Sen. Shehu Sani, has attributed the success of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna state parliamentary elections to strategic interface and grassroots mobilisation of the downtrodden. Sani told newsmen in Abuja on Thursday that prior to the election, a Technical Committee was inaugurated by the Kaduna state Chapter of PDP with him as Chairman. Former Commissioner in Kaduna State, Mohammed Wusolo and ex-Kaduna House of Assembly Speaker, Mr Farakwai served as members. He said the committee designed and embarked on a functional strategy to upstage the All Progressive Party (APC’s) National Assembly and the State Government’s preferred candidates in Feb. 25 elections. Sani, a civil rights activist, said the committee mobilised members, voters and reached out to women and youth groups across party lines. According to him, the committee also reached out to traditional rulers, workers and the aggrieved retrenched teachers in the state. He said the committee embarked on mass media campaigns with support and solidarity of the public in the state. This, he said, resulted in the opposition PDP wining 70 per cent of the seats contested for the parliamentary election. According to him, results as announced by INEC indicate that the ruling APC won in four, while LP secured two seats, representing 20% and 10% respectively. Sani said the results indicated that PDP finally garnered 10 of the 16 Federal Constituency seats in Kaduna. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) ================== Edited by Dorcas Jonah/Idris Abdulrahman
