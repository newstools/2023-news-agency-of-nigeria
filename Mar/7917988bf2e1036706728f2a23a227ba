By Ginika Okoye Norrenberger, a financial services group, says it will sensitise stakeholders and winners of its Fit-life event to get more from their monies by exposing them to strategic investment opportunities. Norrenberger is an industry leading, integrated financial services group offering asset management, investment banking, pensions, insurance and securities trading services. A statement by the Chief Finance Officer of the group, Nkiru Chime, in Abuja on Thursday, said they had hosted winners of the event as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility. Chime said the group, as a financial organisation, was looking for initiatives and avenues to impact their teams, clients and the community. “We cannot tell people how to invest but we can guide and work with them to achieve financial inclusion,” she said. She said that one of the group’s strategic plans was to deepen financial inclusion in the country. “We observed that some people do not have financial management skills to manage their funds, hence the need to sensitise and work with them to achieve financial inclusion. “We cannot tell people how to invest but we can guide them and that is what we are doing with our winners from the Fit life event,” Chime said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Norrenberger component companies are licensed by the Securities & Exchange Commission, National Pension Commission (PENCOM) and National Insurance Commission (NAICOM).
