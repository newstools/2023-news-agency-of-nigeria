By Emmanuel Oloniruha The Goodluck Jonathan Foundation has called on government and other stakeholders to address structural biases against women and girls in order to build an equitable and peaceful society. Executive Director of the Foundation, Ms Ann Iyonu, gave the advice in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday to mark this year’s International Women’s Day. Iyonu said that 2023 celebrations called for urgent action towards eliminating gender violence as well as the need for increased investment in technology for women and girls. She said that Nigerian women had been making significant contributions toward sustainable development of the country. “It is therefore timely for governments across levels to initiate policies and programmes that will address the systemic biases against women.” She said that the foundation acknowledged and appreciated the strides and notable contributions of women toward sustainable development and nation building. “This year’s theme ‘DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality’, highlights the need for increased investment in technology for girls and women in our society. “It is also an urgent task to ensure that violence against women both online and offline are addressed. “On International Women’s Day 2023, we renew our call for an inclusive society, one that is just, equitable, devoid of bias and discrimination. “Let us embrace equity in all spheres of our society, by initiating policies and programmes that will address structural biases against women and girls. This way, we can build an equitable and peaceful society.”(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Ismail AbdulAziz
