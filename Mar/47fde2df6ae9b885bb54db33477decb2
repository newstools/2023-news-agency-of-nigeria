By Ijeoma Okigbo Aderonke Ogunleye-Bello, the Executive Director of Fame Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), on Wednesday in Abuja called for equality and better welfare for women athletes in the country. Ogunleye-Bello made the call during the annual football tournament organised by the foundation as part of activities to mark the International Women’s Day (IWD). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that this year’s event was tagged “Embrace Equity”. Ogunleye-Bello urged Nigerians, especially the incoming administration, to look into the welfare of female athletes. “As at today, female athletes do not get the support their male athletes get. It is sad and I think it is something that the incoming government or administration should look at. “They should work together with relevant national sports federations to ensure that there is equality, and the welfare of female athletes is given top-notch attention,’’ she said. The FAME Executive Director also pointed out that sports were an effective tool being used by the foundation to empower women. “As we know, Nigeria is heterogenous in nature and the only thing that brings us together is sports. “We have been Organising this annual tournament for the past five years and the idea is to bring women together to empower them, talk to them on issues surrounding sexual-based violence, leadership and more,’’ she said. A total of eight teams took part in the competition, namely Team Bet9ja, Team Canada, Team FAME/AMAC, Team USA, Team East Africa, Team ASHWAN, Team ANFS and Team NAWOJ. NAN reports that Team NAWOJ, which is from the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists, emerged winners of the competition after a series of matches played from 9 a.m. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) ========= Edited by Olawale Alabi
