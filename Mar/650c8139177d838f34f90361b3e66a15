By lieoma Okigbo Sunday Dare, the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, on Wednesday in Abuja said women in Nigeria are getting more opportunities in sports. Dare said this during an event to celebrate the 2023 International Women’s Day (IWD), organised by the Fame Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). He said the narrative has since changed as it concerns women and opportunities in sports. “First, let me congratulate all Nigerian women and young girls on the event of the IWD. “This day that is set apart by global international organisations to recognise women validates the fact that women have moved up the ladder when it comes to different endeavours in life. “More so, when it comes to sports, there is no longer any class ceiling and Nigeria is a good case. We went to the Olympics, the two people that brought us medals are female. “The same was at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Ninety percent of the medals were won by our young girls who went there. “So, I think that the narrative has since changed. You must pay attention to the women and I think that they are getting a better share. “They’re getting better opportunities. The doors are opening for them. We just need more women and young girls to walk through that door,” Dare added. The Minister, however, lauded Fame Foundation for organising the annual football tournament and called on more well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to replicate same for the empowerment of women. This year’s edition of IWD is tagged “Embrace Equity”.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) =========== Edited by Olawale Alabi
