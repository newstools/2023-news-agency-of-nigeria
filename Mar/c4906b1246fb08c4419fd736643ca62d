By Muhyideen Jimoh Major streets in the FCT erupted into carnival-like celebrations on Wednesday as Sen. Bola Tinubu received his Certificate of Return as the president-elect from INEC’s chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. Shortly after the ceremony which took place at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, supporters of the president-elect went into a frenzy of jubilation around Garki Area 1 shopping complex. The supporters drove in colourful motorcade hoisting the posters of Tinubu and that of Alhaji Kashim Shettima, the vice-president-elect. They performed various car stunts on major streets while chanting “Jagaban’’. Malam Abubakar Mohammed, one of the supporters said they were happy Tinubu won the keenly-contested election. “Jagaban is a good man; we are happy that he won the election,’’ he said. Mohammed, however, called on the president-elect to focus on improving the lives of the masses. Another supporter, Malam Nura Ismail said the victory was for all Nigerians and charged the president-elect to improve on the economic and security situation in the country. “This celebration is to thank Allah for the victory of Jagaban (Tinubu) at the polls; we urge him to improve on the economic and security situation when he is sworn in,’’ he said. Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) polled 8,794,726 votes to win the 2023 presidential election. He defeated Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Mr Peter Obi of Labour Party to emerge victorious. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) ========= Edited by Alli Hakeem
