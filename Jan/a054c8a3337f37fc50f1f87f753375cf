By Salisu Sani-Idris An Abuja-based Islamic Cleric, Imam Yahya Al-Yolawi has urged political parties and their flag bearers vying for various elective positions to fear Allah and fulfil their electoral promises if elected. Al-Yolawi, who is the Chief Iman of Nurul Yaqeen Jumma’at Mosque Life Camp, made the call while delivering his Jumma’ during a sermon titled: “Amana (trust) in leadership”, on Friday in Abuja. The cleric said that trust in Islam implies honouring, fulfilling commitments, accountability, transparency, covenant, keeping promises, and perfection of obligation assigned to someone. Al-Yolawi also stated that being truthful in promises and covenant was one of the best characteristics by which the true believers were known with. He said that prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon) was recognised even before His prophethood to be al-Amin or the trustworthy one. ” It also covers moral, social, legal, religious assignment, political appointment duties and obligations people entrusted upon you. ” I will like to remind our brothers and sisters in Islam, particularly our political parties, candidates and those who want to be entrusted with public funds, lives of people, property and political leadership by election or appointments; that they should fear Allah and keep their Amana (trust) as their duty toward Allah and His messenger. “They also need to learn from the mistakes of their immediate past predecessors; leadership is a trust and they will be asked on what they were entrusted upon on the day of judgement.” Al-Yolawi noted that Islam encourages entrusting people with trust and integrity, saying “indeed Allah commands you to render trust to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. ” Excellent is that which Allah instructs you, indeed, Allah is ever hearing and seeing.” (NAN) Edited by Grace Yussuf
