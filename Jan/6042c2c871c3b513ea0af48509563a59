By Kayode Adebiyi Dr Alhassan Sule, Acting Chairman of the Federal Capital Territory Universal Basic Education Board, has been presented with the award of the Most Prudent State Universal Basic Education Board Chairman for the North-Central geo-political zone. The recognition was presented to Dr Sule by Dr Isiaka Kolawole, Deputy Executive Secretary, Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), at the National finals of the 62nd Independence Anniversary of the President’s Inter-Basic (Primary) Schools Debate Championship. The debate is organised by the President’s School Debate Nigeria, in collaboration with UBEC, and took place at the main auditorium of the Federal Ministry of Education headquarters in Abuja. In his welcome address, the National Coordinator, President’s School Debate Nigeria, Elder Dare Oritu, said that debate is often deployed all over the world as a tool for dialogue between conflicting groups. He stressed the importance of debates in conflict resolution among diverse groups, especially in an emerging democracy such as Nigeria. Oritu also expressed appreciation to the UBEC Executive Secretary, Dr Hammid Bobboyi, for collaborating with and supporting the President’s School Debate Nigeria. While thanking the Federal Ministry of Education and the National Senior Secondary Education Commission for their technical support, Oritu called for more focus on national discourse. Responding to the recognition accorded the FCT UBEB, Dr Sule said, being a victim of kidnapping for ransom, he has found that moulding the characters of children in the classroom would go a long way in reducing societal ills. He also used the opportunity to appreciate the Minister of State, FCT, Dr Ramatu Aliyu, for giving him the enabling environment to ensure that every child resident in the FCT gets access to qualitative and free basic education.
