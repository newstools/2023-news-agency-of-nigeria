By Chijioke Okoronkwo Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the sum of N75billion for the reconstruction of the dualized Lokoja-Benin Road. The road project extends from the Obajana Junction in Kogi to Benin, the capital of Edo. Agba gave the commendation at the end of the Federal executive Council meeting on Wednesday in Abuja. The approval was given to cover section 2 of the road from Okene-Auchi, section three from Auchi – Ehor and section four from Ehor – Benin at the cost of N25 billion each. The approved proposal was captured in the memo for the reconstruction of select federal roads under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme Phase 2 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited. Agba further thanked the President for also approving N64 billion for the Benin-Warri dual carriageway. He said that the President deserved commendation by the good people of Edo and South-South for including the roads in the Phase 2 scheme. “The Lokoja-Benin road is a critical asset that links the entire South-south zone to the Northern part of the country. It is also an ongoing project with contractors already on ground to resume and/or continue work once they are mobilized.” Agba singled out the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fasola, for his commitment and contribution towards securing both presidential and FEC approvals for the road projects that begin from Edo and terminate in Kogi and Delta States.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Ismail Abdulaziz
