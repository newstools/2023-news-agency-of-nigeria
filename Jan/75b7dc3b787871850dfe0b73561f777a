By Femi Ogunshola JACCO’S Charity International (JCI), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), says it plans to embark on violence free campaign across the six zones of the country, ahead of the 2023 general election. The Founder,  JCI, Mrs Jodie Frank stated this in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, adding that the move was to ensure a violence free 2023 election. Frank said the campaign would begin with on Jan. 29 in Abia in South East, targeting two densely populated communities. “It is expected that residents of the communities will transmit the message to other people residing outside the state capital,” she said. She said that other states included Lagos State, Rivers, Bauchi State, Kano State and the FCT which would be the final destination. She said that Lagos would take the turn of South West on Feb. 2 and  South South in Port Harcourt on Feb. 5. “The North West campaign will take place in Kano on Feb. 7, North East in Bauchi on Feb. 9 and North Central in Abuja on Feb. 11,” she said. She said the campaign would be a carnival like where Nigerians would be enlightened on the need to avoid violence and political brigandage on election day. She urged political parties, their candidates and supporters to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship after a winner had emerged. “In politics there must be winners and losers, so whatever the outcome is, we want all political parties, their candidates and supporters to embrace the spirit of sportsmanship,” she said. She said the idea behind the campaign was to ensure peace before, during and after the election. Frank said that no blood of any Nigerian was worth political ambition of any candidate or political party, adding that this was what the central message of JCI.
