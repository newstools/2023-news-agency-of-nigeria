By Salisu Sani-Idris Ahmed Wadada, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Senatorial candidate for Nasarawa Western Zone, has cautioned youths against involvement in all forms of electoral violence during the forthcoming general elections. Wadada made the call while addressing his teeming supporters at Aso/Kodape Ward in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, on Tuesday. He also enjoined the youths not to allow any desperate groups or politicians to instigate them to disrupt peaceful atmosphere in the state as the preparations for the forthcoming election gathered momentum. Wadada, who described youths as the most important segment of every society, urged them to use their numerical strength to ensure the actualisation of the desired change in the senatorial district. The former two-term member of the House of Representatives also admonished the youths to shun thuggery, hate speech and any form of action that could trigger violence. Wadada said: “My usual appeal to the youths in Nasarawa West Senatorial district and the state in general is that they shouldn’t allow themselves to be use by desperate politicians to cause violence. ” Election is not a war. It’s like a sports and it’s also about dialogue, negotiations and exchange of ideas aimed at improving the living conditions of the ordinary citizens, thereby adding value to the society.” The SDP chieftain reiterated his  commitment to ensure better representation to the people of the district, if given the mandate. Wadada added: “I represented Kokona, Keffi and Karu Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives from 2003 and 2011 and my representation was felt not only in my constituency, but in the entire Nasarawa and the country at large. ” Therefore, my antecedents speak for me. I have added the needed value to the lives of my people and God willing, if I am giving another mandate, I will not fail my constituents. “I will redouble efforts in ensuring that my Senatorial dustrict enjoy more dividends of democracy.” On his part, Rep. Jonathan Gaza, who is seeking reelection enjoined the electorate not to sell their votes. Gaza also promised to attract more constituency projects, if given the mandate for the third term under the platform of SDP. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64228" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230124_144915_208-scaled.jpg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Wadada and Gaza led a delegation of their campaign teams and teeming supporters to pay homage to the Etsu of Kodape, Amb.
