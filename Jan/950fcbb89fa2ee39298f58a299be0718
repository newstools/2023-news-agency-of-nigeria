By Sumaila Ogbaje A civil society group, Alliance for Protection of Democracy (APD), has commended the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor for ensuring that the military remained committed to protecting the nation’s democracy. This was contained in a statement signed by Secretary of the group, Bimbo Salau and made available to newsmen in Abuja on Monday. According to him, the assurance given by the CDS about the readiness of the military to support the Police in ensuring hitch-free elections, was worthy of commendation. He added that Irabo’s comment that “democracy has come to stay because it’s a system of government that gives people the power to determine who govern them”, was a big relief to Nigerians. The Secretary said it was a strong signal to those who are bent on giving negative narratives on the outcome of the elections. “This statement is a warning to those who want to truncate the nation’s democracy, as the military will deal with anybody who tried to subvert it. “Nigerians must support all the security agencies in order to ensure peaceful general elections. “We in APD commend the CDS and the AFN for the unwavering disposition towards sustenance of democracy in our country. “Without doubt, Gen. Irabor is positively showing the way forward for his troops,” he said. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Hajara Leman/Maharazu Ahmed
