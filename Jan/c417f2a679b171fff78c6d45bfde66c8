By George Odok The Cross River Chapter of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has endorsed the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the state, Sen. Bassey Otu, for the 2023 polls. Mr Daniel Obo, Chairman of NYCN in the state, said this on Wednesday in Calabar during a town hall engagement with youth leaders in Southern Senatorial District of the state. He said that the council endorsed the governorship candidate of the APC and adopted the party because of its youth friendly disposition. “We are not going back in our support for the governorship candidate of Cross River and we will win because we have 70 per cent of the votes. “We have come here to reaffirm our commitment as an institution. We will stand for the party that recognises young people. “We, the youth council in Cross River will support the APC and will mobilise our youths to stand with the party, and God willing, we will win,” he said. Obo said that governorship position in the state rotates round the three senatorial zones of the state for equity, fairness and justice. “The position of governor rotates around the three senatorial districts. It is the turn of Cross River South to produce the next governor. “About 80 per cent of the youths are with us; and as you know, politics is a game of interest. “We have one of us as a deputy governorship candidate in APC; we will try our best to see that his ambition sees the light of the day,” he said. Obo said that the governorship candidate shared with the council his plans for youth development in the state and his antecedents as a lawmaker in the National Assembly. “It is no longer time to hijack materials or send youths to fight against themselves, but the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System will speak for itself.” The chairman, therefore, encouraged the youths to get their Permanent Voter Cards ahead of the polls.
