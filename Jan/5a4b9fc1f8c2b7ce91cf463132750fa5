By Ikenna Osuoha Ms May Ikokwu, Chief Executive Officer, Save Our Heritage Initiative (SOHI) has called for the exploration of the country’s heritage treasures for sustainable development. Ikokwu made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the occasion of World Heritage Treasure Day in Abuja on Wednesday. She expressed concern over the near extinction of the country’s cultural and demographic heritages. The Culture Advocate, who reiterated the need to preserve heritage artifacts, said that they play important roles in not only development but unity of the country. “We should explore some of those places and artifacts that stand as a testament to human history. “Local museums and buildings can hold important pieces of what helped build the community. “While parks and wildlife can help to preserve pieces of the natural world that existed before humans set foot there,” she said. The SOHI boss expressed deep concern over the sale of Heritage sites along river banks for real estate development, regardless of fern and fauna, which are disappearing at an alarming rate. Ikokwu called on government and relevant stakeholders to explore and preserve Old Oyo in southwest Nigeria, which is said to be the former city of Oyo (known as Oyo-Ile), deserted in the 18th century. She said the Ogbunike Caves are found in a valley in the tropical forest of southeast Nigeria, in Anambra should also be preserved. Ikokwu added; “Oban Hills and landscape located at Cross River National Park and Ancient Walls of Kano made of earth should be given prior attention and preservation. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that World Heritage Treasure Day is marked on Jan 11 annually. It is used to celebrate cultural artifacts and iconic landmarks.
