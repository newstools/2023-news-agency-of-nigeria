By Ibironke Ariyo   The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) on Friday advised motorists against the use of 18-seater buses for long distance travels. The Corps Marshal of FRSC, Dauda Biu, who gave the advice at a news conference in Abuja, said most traffic accidents recorded in the country involved 18-seater buses. According to him, the 18-seater buses were designed for short distance travels. Biu also said there was alarming rate of crashes and fatalities from accidents that occurred as a result of night journeys and excessive speed in the country. “A lot of crashes we have recorded involved 18-seater buses and the crashes also occurred at night. This is devastating and worrisome. “To this end, great emphasis must be made to discourage the use of 18 seater buses registered under intra state mass transit, for inter-state long journeys. “A practice that contradicts the use of high capacity luxury buses specifically designed for such purposes,” he said. Biu said that the Corps had put in measures to ensure drastic decline in road traffic crashes by up-scaling and improving the quality of its public education and enforcement campaigns. He said the corps would constitute a think-tank to map out strategic initiatives for the rebirth and upgrade of enlightenment campaigns in motor parks across the country. The corps marshal added that the FRSC would broaden existing relationship with stakeholders to secure their buy-in on driver education. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Dorcas Jonah/Maharazu Ahmed
