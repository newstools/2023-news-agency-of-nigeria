Ibukun Emiola The Management of The Polytechnic, Ibadan has reversed itself and lifted the suspension earlier placed on the institution’s Students’ Union Government. This is contained in a statement issued by the institution’s Registrar, Mrs Modupe Fawale, in Ibadan on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the institution had earlier suspended the Students’ Union Executives and its activities indefinitely, over alleged protest by students in the early hours of Monday. Fawale said that the reversal of the suspension order earlier placed on the union was based on interventions in order to allow for further consultations. “The management has decided not to use the big stick on the students, as they have also sheathed their swords. “The management will be holding meetings with the leadership of the students to address their perceived grievances,” she said. The registrar, however, said that the first semester examination, scheduled to commence on Jan. 9, remained postponed. “A new date for the commencement of the examination will be announced to the students through appropriate channels,” she said.
