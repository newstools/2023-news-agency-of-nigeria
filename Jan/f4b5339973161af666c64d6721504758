By David Adeoye Oyo State Government on Thursday signed two Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the French Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the MOU included a concessionaire loan of 55 million Euro for the state health programme and the second MOU is for the promotion of French Language in the state educational system. The event was held at the Executive Chamber of the Governorâ€™s office, State Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan. Gov. Seyi Makinde led the state top government functionaries to sign the two MOU, while the French Ambassador to Nigeria, Mrs Emmanuelle Blatmann, led the French delegation. In his remarks, Makinde said the loan with 0.0009 per cent interest was specifically to be used for the upgrading of Adeoyo General Hospital, Ibadan and all other General Hospitals across the geopolitical zones in the state. He explained that the second MOU would enhance the promotion and teaching of French Language in the state schools. Makinde said that French Language was a major language of international relation, expressing optimism that it would boost commerce and development. The state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Oyewo Oyelowo, had earlier explained that the 55 million Euro concessionaire loan would be used to refurbish Adeoyo General Hospital and other general hospitals across the state, under the new healthcare initiative of the Makinde-led administration. Oyelowo said the loan with a very low interest rate would be paid back in 40 years. He said that the second MOU was worthwhile, pointing out that it would pace way for the learning of French Language in the state schools and among the citizens. Also, the French Ambassador, Blatmann, said the loan, extended to an African country in 30 years, would engender healthcare, qualitative education and globalisation of the state.(NAN) Edited by Olagoke Olatoye
