Campaign By Femi Ogunshola Prof. Wale Sulaiman, the Kwara South Social Democratic Party (SDP) Senatorial candidate, has expressed readiness to meet with his constituents resident in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Feb 2. The senatorial candidate said this in a statement he signed and made available to newsmen in Abuja on Monday. He said the meeting became necessary to acquaint the people of his manifestoes ahead of the February general lections. Sulaiman said that he had earlier met with the people of his constituency living in Lagos State to show support for his candidacy and tell them about his aspiration to become their representative at the red chamber. The Professor of neurosurgeon and spinal surgery said he wanted to become their senator because of his passion for development, while promising the people of the district a better deal if elected. Sulaiman promised to change the face of development in the senatorial district by showing example from previous representation. He expressed worry over the level of under-development in the district, adding that it was akin to poor leadership recruitment. He said his coming out as the candidate of SDP would change the face of representation in the district, while calling on Kwara South living in Abuja to attend the meeting. According to him, I have heard series of complain from my people in Kwara south how as soon as they elect their senator they become a total stranger to them. He said, “I have the expertise to attract jobs for my people and provide workable healthcare, and education, I will be the people’s senator, who constituents can access without recourse to undue protocol.
