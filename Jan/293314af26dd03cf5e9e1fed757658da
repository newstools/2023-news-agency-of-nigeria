By Olasunkanmi Onifade Mr Abubakar Rilwanu,     Principal, School For The Gifted, Gwagwalada,, on Thursday, appealed to Nigerians to support efforts of government towards developing sports in schools. The Principal, who made this appeal during the annual Inter-house sports competition in Abuja, said this would promote the expansion of current activities and encourage participation. He said the school had been faced with the challenges of insufficient sporting facilities, adding that this had dampened the enthusiasm and love for sports. “From among these youngsters today can emerge national and international champions. It is my sincere desire and prayers that young talents be discovered in this event. ” As you all know, sports is a goldmine in disguise, so students should use this opportunity, but remember to cultivate the spirit of sportsmanship,” Rilwanu said. He said sports played major role in the mental, physical and psychological development of an individual, saying that was the reason why the FCT Secondary Education Board encouraged public secondary schools to carry out sporting activities. The Chairman of the Occasion, Mr Clement Oluwafemi, stressed the importance of sports in schools, adding that education was holistic, ”hence learners are expected to develop mentally, emotionally and physically.” He, however, encouraged the students to exhibit the spirit of sportsmanship, adding that sports required teamwork in the pursuit of mutual goals to achieve success. “With sports, young people learn to recognise as well as value the unique and important contributions of their diverse teammates. ” Sports is essential to learning as it teaches children life skills like teamwork, leadership and patience, “Oluwafemi said. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG-20230127-WA0011-151x300.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64623" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG-20230127-WA0011-151x300.jpg 151w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG-20230127-WA0011-515x1024.jpg 515w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG-20230127-WA0011.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 151px) 100vw, 151px" /> The Sport Master of the School, Mr Ghazali Mohammed, said the purpose of event was to bring out the spirit of competition in the students as it is a tool for the students’ academic performances. ” Sports make the students aware that this life is equally a race which one must continue to strive and not give up as well as there is no room for laziness at all. “From the results of the competition, it is also observed that sometimes when you fail in life, it is a challenge and an opportunity not to be discouraged on becoming successful in life,” he said.
