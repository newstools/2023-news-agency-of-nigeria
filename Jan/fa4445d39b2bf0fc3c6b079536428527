Mr Jibrin Tatabe   By Femi Ogunshola Mr Jibrin Tatabe has expressed delight over his reinstatement as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Borno Central Senatorial District by the Federal High Court sitting in Maiduguri. This is contained in a statement made available by Mr Aminu Yakudima, his Personal Assistant in Abuja on Monday. The court had on Jan. 9 declared Tatabe as the authentic PDP candidate for Borno Central Senatorial District by Federal High Court in Maiduguri, in the Feb. 25 general election. He said the ruling, which was given by Justice Jude K. Dagat, brought an end to a long-standing dispute within the PDP over the candidacy for the senatorial ticket. He said Tatabe had suffered a great deal of injustice over his nomination in the PDP, while expressing his delight at the court’s ruling. He said: “I am honoured and humbled by the court’s decision. This is a victory not just for me, but for the good people of Borno Central who have been yearning for a credible representative.” According to him, he truly care about the well-being of his constituents “and this they will definitely found in me. I assure them that if elected, I will work tirelessly to bring about the much needed change”. He promised to bring development to their doorsteps in the whole district, adding that the PDP had also welcomed the court’s judgment and ready to comply forthwith. He therefore called on all party members and supporters to rally behind the candidate and its Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, as committed party men and good leaders.
