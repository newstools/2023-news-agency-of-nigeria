By Salisu Sani-Idris An Abuja-based Islamic cleric, Imam Yahya Al-Yolawi has advised Muslims, especially the youths against promoting tribal and religious sentiments in the ongoing political campaigns for the 2023 general elections. Al-Yolawi gave the advice while delivering his Jumma’at sermon titled,”Islamic Brotherhood and Unity of the Muslim community”, on Friday in Abuja. He said: ”Muslims are identified as brothers just like a whole piece of building, when a part is broken, it disfigures or destroys or affects the rest part.” The cleric stated that Islam considered all Muslims to be brothers and sisters as one Ummah, as a community based on faith and persuasion of common objectives and worship of Allah, the Most High. ” This brotherhood doesn’t allow the differences of region, nation, race, locality, language, and or political party to disrupt and disintegrate it. ” I will like to seize this opportunity to appeal to the generality of Muslims and non Muslims youths of this great nation to be calm and law abiding. ” I also call on all Nigerians to shun violence by all means, as well as reprisal attacks and taking law into their own hands. ”It is unIslamic and can lead only to more harm and troubles to our people. ” Lets find a way or legal means of showing or displaying our grievances but not through violence and protest,” Al-Yolawi said.
