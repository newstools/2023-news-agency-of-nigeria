Speaking after the campaigns, Wadada lauded the high turnout of of people at the various wards and attributed the development to his party’s acceptance by the electorate in the area. “I want to assure you that this is not a rented crowd. This is a build up crowd. “When we left my house with Honourable Gaza and other party members, we had only our vehicles on the convoy. “As we drove from the campaign office to the first venue, the crowd began to build up. “We are too much and widely accepted by the special grace of God. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-63228" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_151545_053-scaled.jpg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> “The team of Wadada, Gaza and others will be ingrates if we rent crowds given the love and acceptance the people had freely offered us,” he said. Wadada said the affection and support shown by the crowd was reciprocal to the support and concern the party and its candidates have shown to the people, especially the poor in the past. “Every local government we go, you will see exactly this turnout because it is about the people and we have been with the people. “We have shown love. We have shown concern. We have shown care to the people. “When I represented this Federal Constituency, my representation was a caring, educating and enlightening representation. “It was also a very laudable and effective representation and that is exactly what Honourable Gaza is doing. “The other candidates with us have not been elected before, but by their antecedents, they have cared, shown love, managed the people,” he said. Wadada added that the significance of the campaign inauguration was to show that SDP and its candidates were the best choices for the seats they were contesting for. In an interview, Gaza said since he ventured into politics he has made it a personal policy to work for the people who elected him and not take what belongs to others for himself. This, he added, informed the popularity he has been enjoying and the large turnout of people to show support for him and SDP. “I keep what is for the people to the people and what is for me by way of my allowances, I keep for myself. “So, having the fear of God and the ultimate desire that knowing that one day when you leave this earth is very important. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-63229" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_20230109_113842_659-scaled.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> “Once you have this and you know that you are going to meet your creator and you are going to give account, by God’s special grace, you will do your best,” he said. Gaza said that he was focused on winning the 2023 general elections and getting another opportunity to serve his people for another term of four years. He assured, “every ward across the federal constituency and the senatorial district would be visited and the people afforded the opportunity to interact and exchange ideas with the party and its flagbearers in the zone.” Also speaking, Mr Abdullahi Abubakar, the SDP candidate for Keffi East Constituency in Nasarawa State House of Assembly, said the chances of winning any election lied with the people. “From every indication, we have seen that the mammoth crowd here will give us the maximum votes we deserve and by the grace of God, we will come out victorious,” he said. NAN reports that the highlight of the event was the distribution of 100 wrappers and a cash donation of N350,000 in each of the five wards visited in Keffi Local Government Area.
