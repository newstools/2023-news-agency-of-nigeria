By Precious Akutamadu The National Vice Chairman of Labour Party, South-South, Prince Reuben, has urged the people of Rivers to vote according to their conscience on Feb. 25 and March 11 general elections. Reuben, who gave the advise at a press briefing on Tuesday in Port Harcourt, said that the people’s choice at the general election would define the destiny of Nigerians. According to him, the choice they make will either make or mar their entire generation. He alleged that the state had been impoverished in the midst of abundant resources. Reuben also alleged that the Gov. Nyesom Wike of Rivers was in a political alliance with the All Progressive Congress (APC) to vote for its Presidential candidate, Sen. Bola Tinubu, in Rivers. Reuben further alleged that since Gov. Wike had earlier said that ‘APC is cancer while PDP is Malaria’, he expected the governor to find the cure in the LP. ”I was expecting him to look for the cure of the deadly disease, which is Labour Party’s candidate who have been tested and trusted to align with. ”Rather, he asked his followers to vote for the APC Presidential candidate. ”Let Gov. Wike deny this if it’s not true that he asked his followers to work for the APC Presidential candidate. ”I am calling on all well-meaning Rivers men and women to come out in en masse to vote for all the candidates of Labour party, come Feb. 25, and March, 11,” Reuben said. But Gov. Wike, in a statement on Feb. 20 by his Media aide, Mr Kelvin Ebiri, stated that he will never join the APC. Wike had also described insinuations that he would defect to the APC as speculative. He maintained that he remained an unrepentant member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). ”I am not a member of APC and I will not be,” the statement added.
