By Taiye Olayemi The Creative Industry Group (CIG) has called on its members across the country to ensure they exercised their civic responsibility during the fast approaching general elections slated for Feb. 25. Amb Felix Duke, National President of CIG in a statement on Thursday, said that due to the general elections, the group had postponed its “Industry Nite” which was to hold in February. “That time has come again in the course of our nation’s history when we are all expected to perform our civic responsibility by going out there to cast our votes for our preferred candidates. “This month’s “Industry Nite”, therefore, is put on hold to enable us to reminiscence and reassess our current political status as a nation. “This is to enable us cast our vote for those candidates we believe can take us out of this quagmire. “Remember that as entertainers, we are usually the first casualties each time the economy goes down, therefore, we need to be very wise in our choice of candidates,” he said. Duke noted that CIG was a non-partisan and non-denominational organization but a major stakeholder in the politics of Nigeria. “Please do not sit on the fence or stay aloof during this electoral exercise as we reap what we sow and you cannot harvest yam if you planted rice. Let us do the right thing. (NAN) (nannews.ng)
