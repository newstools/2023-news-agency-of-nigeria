By Sumaila Ogbaje The Unity Advocacy Group (UAG), a civil society organisation, has cautioned politicians against dragging the military into politics. The group in a statement by its Convener, Ifeanyi Aigbedion, on Sunday in Abuja, condemned a purported tweet by Chief Femi Fani-Kayode which alleged that some military officers met with a presidential candidate in Abuja Aigbedion alleged that in the tweet, Fani-Kayode insinuated that such meeting could disrupt the elections, destabilise the country, set Nigeria on fire and incite chaos. He added that the allegation was capable of causing more tension in the country in view of the already politically charged atmosphere. The UAG convener said they were deeply concerned about underground plots by some disgruntled elements to derail the nation’s march to a stable democracy. “We are concerned the more, of attempts to draw the Armed forces of Nigeria into the political arena. This is capable of setting the nation on fire. “A close observation reveals that the Armed forces under Gen Lucky Irabor has subordinated itself to democratic tenets and will never align with anyone to draw the country backward. “UAG is not here to defend anyone, or any of the political parties, but to advise politicians to allow the will of God prevail in the ongoing political process. They must learn how to give and take. “From our observation, the military, already engaged in various operations aimed at restoration of peace, will continue to support the growth of our nascent democracy. “Drawing them into the political arena is a disservice and must stop,” he added.
