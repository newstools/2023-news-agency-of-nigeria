By Oluwafunke Ishola Dr Akintoye Akindele, Tech Investor and Chief Executive Officer of Platform Capital, says he has impacted over 100,000 youth entrepreneurs locally and internationally. Akindele in a statement on Friday in Lagos said he would continue to support and donate to various institutions that provide grants to entrepreneurs. “I am passionate about Africa and want to see to it that African entrepreneurs, youths and business people become very successful and relevant globally. “I will not stop regardless of obstacles, until the dream of an empowered Africa, which will deliver maximum dividends to Africans from its vast natural and human resources is birthed,” he said. Akindele said that this would be done through his growth market focussed investment firm with portfolio value in excess of 1.5 billion dollars. According to him, it has its presence in eight countries across five continents and over 170 investments, including five global Venture Capital funds in nine sectors. He is also the Founder, Duport Midstream Ltd., which is creating Nigeria and Africa’s first energy park in Edo. Akindele said he was one of the few invited Nigerians that had the rare privilege of meeting King Charles III of the United Kingdom on Jan. 26, when The Africa Centre UK hosted his Majesty to a tour of his Headquarters in Southwark, London. He said that the discussions centred on building and fostering critical dialogue on creating a sustainable future for Africans. Akindele said he would continue to promote Africa’s narrative through his speaking engagements at leading business schools, conferences and seminars on investing in Africa. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Platform Capital had in May 2022 invested in Zuri Health, a company that connects patients with affordable healthcare services via SMS, WhatsApp and a dedicated app. (NAN) (nannews.ng) Edited by Olagoke Olatoye
