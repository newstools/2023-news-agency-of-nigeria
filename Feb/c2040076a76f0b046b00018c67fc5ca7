By Salisu Sani-Idris The Sokoto State All Progressives Council campaign team has reemphasised it’s commitment to embark on an electioneering campaign without violence in spite of alleged provocation by the opposition in the state. Sen. Aliyu Wamakko gave the assurance in a statement by Dr Danladi Bako, the Chairman, Publicity, Sokoto State APC Campaign Council and member of the party’s Presidential Campaign Council Media Directorate, on Thursday. Wamakko spoke to newsmen after a caucus meeting on the outcome of a briefing by the heads of security agencies with political parties in the state, attended by State APC Chairman, Isa Achida. He rejected insinuations or allegations that the APC was responsible for the increased violent clashes and counter-clashes during political campaigns in the last one month within the state. The former governor of Sokoto state reassured APC faithful , residents and the public of the party’s resolve to commit itself to a very peaceful electioneering campaign. He called on the PDP to endeavour to disarm its youth wing and educate them on the need for peace and tranquility as we approached the general elections. According to him, APC as a party is made up of decent and peace loving citizens, and encouraged all residents of Sokoto to abhor violence and embrace peace during “this period and in future”. The caucus meeting was attended by the Director-General of the APC Campaign and Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi and other party bigwigs. Violent clashes have become a regular occurrence within the state recently, prompting Sultan Sa’ad Abubakar to call on politicians to carry out their campaigns in a peaceful and violence-free environment.
