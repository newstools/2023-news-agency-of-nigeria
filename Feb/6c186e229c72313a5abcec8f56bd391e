Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, Queen Jodie Frank, founder JACCO Charity International, an NGO and Rev Osadolor, member of the NGO By Femi Ogunshola The Governor of Abia, Mr Okezie Ikpeazu, has endorsed the call for violence-free campaign across the six geopolitical zones of the country by JACCO Charity International (JCI), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). Jodie Frank, the founder of the NGO said this in a statement in Abuja on Monday. She said the group visited the governor to seek his endorsement since the campaign would be kick starting in Abia. The governor, however, said that the vote of every Nigerian should count during elections, adding that no vote is worth the blood of any Nigerian. He commended the NGO for taking the initiative and choosing his state as the first point of call, adding that he would be ready to support the group to ensure a successful violence-free campaign. The group, however, presented a T-shirt with the inscription “Your Vote Counts” to the governor. On her part, Frank said the the reason for the campaign was to ensure that the youth who constitute the bulk of voters do not engage in violence before, during and after the election. According to her, “we want to ensure that Nigerian votes count, we want a better Nigeria and our vote will be the bedrock for a better country.” She urged political parties, their candidates and supporters to play by the rule and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship after the election. She called on Nigerians not to toe the path of violence whatever the outcome of the election is, adding that Nigerians should embrace peace for the sake of unity.
