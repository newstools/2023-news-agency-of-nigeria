By Peter Amine Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau, Dr Nentawe Yilwatda says agriculture would be his main focus if elected at the 2023 general elections.   His campaign spokesperson, Mr Shittu Bamayi, stated in Jos on Sunday that Yilwatda made the pronouncement on Saturday at interactive sessions with three communities in Langtang South Local Government Area of the state.   Yilwatda said he was amazed by the vast uncultivated arable land in the local government area saying that such endowment was enough to pull the people out of poverty.   “Boosting agriculture remains one of my cardinal objectives and I will go the whole hog to support farmers through the provision of high-yielding seedlings and modern farming technology.   “The people cannot enjoy the fruits of their labour in terms of food production if certain basic amenities are not provided to them.   “Apart from giving support to farmers, we will ensure that as a matter of priority, the lives of the people are properly secured.   “We will do that through well-trained security personnel and modern technology to fight terrorism and other forms of criminality,’’ he assured.   Yilwatda said the first thing to be done if elected would be to provide roads and potable water for people in communities visited.   He commended the Taroh people for being good and dependable hosts to many ethnic nationalities in the area who were purposely there to farm and earn a living.
