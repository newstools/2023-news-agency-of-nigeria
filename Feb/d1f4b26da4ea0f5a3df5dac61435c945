By Stephen Adeleye Sen. Bola Tinubu, the Presidential Candidate for the All Progressives Congress (APC), has promised to resuscitate Ajaokuta Steel Complex Ltd. and to dredge River Niger, if elected president. Tinubu gave the assurance at the APC Kogi mega rally on Wednesday at Confluence Stadium Lokoja. ”I assure you that hope is here, Ajaokuta steel will be resuscitated and running, the dredging of River Niger will be done and agriculture will be our means of livelihood and prosperity. ”The North-Central zone has potential of great mineral resources, industrialisation, fabrication and industrial development,” Tinubu said. The APC presidential candidate assured the people of a flourishing quality education, industrialisation and progress. Tinubu commended the APC supporters in Kogi for mobilising themselves and managing to get to the stadium for the mega rally. ”Let me assure you that this your sacrifice will not go in vain. I thank you all,” he said. Tinubu, however, urged the people to consolidate their support for the party to come out on Feb. 25 to cast their votes for APC candidates at all levels. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230208-WA0036-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65588" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230208-WA0036-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230208-WA0036-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230208-WA0036.jpg 942w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Earlier, Gov.
