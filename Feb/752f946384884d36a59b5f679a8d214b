By Bukola Adewumi Rev. Adedoyin Adeyinka, Senior Pastor of the House of Truth Church, Abuja on Sunday admonished Nigerians to pray for the peace of the nation. Adeyinka said the best thing to do for the country is to pray, while taking his reading from the Book of Jeremiah 29:7 which says “seek the peace of the city”. He said a lot of believers put their hope on what men will do for them instead of what God will do, adding that God is the author and finisher of all things. According to Adeyinka, the 2023 general elections will go well because God is involved in the peace of Nigeria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2023 general elections will commence in Nigeria on Feb. 25 to elect the President, Vice President, and members of the Senate and House of Representatives.
