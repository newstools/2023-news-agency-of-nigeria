By Naomi Sharang Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to create more sensitisation to the use of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for the 2023 general elections. Executive Director of the Civil Society Organisation, Ms Faith Nwadishi, made the call at a news conference in Abuja on Monday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the conference was on the concluded mock trial of the BVAS by INEC, preparatory to the 2023 General Elections. Nwadishi, who called for more sensitisation to the use of the BVAS, also called for the relocation of names to decongest polling units. She said that the CTA, as an election observer group, had embarked on meeting with critical stakeholders across the six geo-political zones and came up with some recommendations. The recommendations, she said, included proper enlightenment and training of party agents, more sensitisation of security agents to the do’s and don’ts at polling units on election days. “More attention should be paid to potential flash points across the country.” Nwadishi, however, commended INEC for the overall performance of the BVAS while also noting improvement in the performance of the system. “As we move closer to the elections, we call on all stakeholders to support INEC towards achieving credible, peaceful, fair, inclusive, and conclusive elections in February and March.”(NAN) (www.nanews.ng) Edited by Idris Abdulrahman
