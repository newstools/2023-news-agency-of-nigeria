By Bridget Ikyado The Creative Director, Potter’s Gallery Initiative, Mr Donald Unanka says the organization will continue to build the capacity of Persons With Disability (PWDs) in the creative industry. Speaking at a workshop organised for PWDs on Thursday in Abuja, Unanka said the intervention was imperative, in order to provide the PWDs with sustainable business skills. According to him, the workshop will enable them to explore other potentials in the creative industry. “We do not want PWDs to be left out of trade and businesses just because they are physically challenged,’’ Unanka said. “Promoting the skills of PWDs would also enhance self-reliance and build their career in different fields. “They will also understand the industry properly and the market for successful businesses,” he said. The Director said the three-day workshop, supported by UNESCO, has more than 50 trainees from various discipline. A beneficiary, Comfort Ekwo said “ I learnt a lot from this workshop which include how to start and improve my business skills.’’ The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the participants were drawn from different businesses and organisations in the Federal Capital Territory.
