By Salisu Sani-Idris A group, Concerned Yoruba Muslim Scholars in Nigeria, on Friday held intercessional prayers for peaceful elections and victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Sen. Bola Tinubu. Addressing newsmen shortly after the prayers at the Abuja National Mosque, the Secretary-General of the scholars, Prof. Olaiya Olaitan, said the situation of things in the country required divine intervention. Olaitain said: “We are gathered here today to seek Allah’s divine favour over the forthcoming elections, pray for peaceful and successful democratic transition. “We are equally praying for victory of our endorsed presidential candidate, Sen. BolaTinubu and his running mate, Sen. Kashim Shettima, who are determined to ensure good governance in the country during their tenure. “The prayers, which are part of a continuous process are also going on at various major central mosques across the country throughout the period of the transition process.” He said the organisation had sat severally and took a decision to endorse Tinubu, adding, “the country is yearning for a capable person that would take over from President Muhammadu Buhari.” Olaitan called on the political players to abide by the law and avoid making statement that could destabilise the country and truncate the electoral process. He said: “We are also appealing to the electorate to be more patient with the leaders at all levels. “This is moreso that the period of the present administration is winding up and be hopeful that if Tinubu is elected, the country will witness more prosperity.” (NAN)(www.nanneww.ng) Edited by Bashir Rabe Mani
