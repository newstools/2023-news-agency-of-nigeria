The club also donated two wheelchairs, one stretcher, medical consumables and renovated the accident/ emergency unit, as well as the matrons’ and nurses’ compound of the hospital. The President, Rotary Club of Abuja, Maitama, Mr Yusuf Alli, said the donation is aimed at complementing government’s efforts in providing quality healthcare services to Nigerians. He said “what we only do is to complement what the government does in any country or environment. `In our case this year, we chose to renovate accident and emergency unit of this hospital. “Drawing from the lessons of COVID-19 and what is happening in Turkey and Syria now, we don’t need a soothsayer to tell us that emergency unit is a fighter component of hospital service. “We have also given birthing kits to pregnant women to assist them in safe delivery, so this is a token contribution to maternal care in the country.” Mr Goddy Nnadi, the Governor, District 9125, said that the medical outreach is part of the club’s committment to fulfilling its humanitarian services to mankind. Nnadi, who commended the club for the numerous humanitarian projects, called on other clubs to focus more on projects that touches human lives. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0004-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66145" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0004-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0004-1024x612.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0004-768x459.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230214-WA0004.jpg 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> He said “this is in line with our seven areas of focus and one of them is child and maternal health and the other one is disease prevention and care. “These are part of the programmes that Rotary Club at the international level had built to fit into the realms of maternal and girl-child, as well as disease prevention and care. “These are multiple projects in one.” Dr Igbinovia Imuentiyan, the Chief Medical Director of Maitama District Hospital, Abuja, thanked the club for the donation, adding that the gesture would boost heathcare services.
