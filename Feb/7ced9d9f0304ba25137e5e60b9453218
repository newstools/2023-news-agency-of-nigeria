By Kingsley Okoye Deputy Chief Whip of the Senate, Sen. Sabi Abdullahi has urged Nigerians, especially members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to keep faith with the party and avoid activities capable of undermining its advancement. Abdullahi, representing Niger-North Senatorial District, made the call in Abuja during an interactive session with newsmen. He was responding to a question on alleged activities targeted against the campaign of the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. “But one thing I know for sure is that in politics, it is not impossible for some people to be unhappy. “They might have a different opinion or idea on what should be within the context of the local politics . “It is not impossible for some people to be angry but one thing I will say is that I will depend on what is on the surface, some people might be unhappy, it is not out of place. “But what is important is that this is our ship, we built it and it will be a disservice if we destroy it,” Abdullahi said. The law maker said it would be in the collective interest of the party to consolidate on what it has achieved in the past years. “By my own tradition and upbringing, if I stick to something, I stick to it in good and in bad. “I have always been a progressive all my life, I believe in my party, I am a progressive in heart and in doing. “I want to advise all APC members to keep faith with the progressive fold and let’s continue to do progressive things for our country. ”And come the general elections, we are hopeful that we will get the mandate and when we get it, more progressive things will come to Nigeria,” Abdullahi said.
