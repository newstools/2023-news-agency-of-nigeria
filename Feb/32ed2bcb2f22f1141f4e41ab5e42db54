By Ruth Oketunde The Daniel Onoja Foundation (DOF), on Tuesday, gave scholarship to no fewer than 100 pupils of the Local Education Authority (L.E.A), Primary School, Lugbe in the FCT. The foundation also donated 100 sets of furniture, as well as school bags, uniforms, books, sandals and stationery to pupils of the school. Mr Daniel Onoja, the Founder of DOF, said the donation was part of the foundation’s commitment to reducing the number of out-of-school children in the country. He said the intervention tagged “DOF-School Intervention Project”, aimed at supporting the efforts of the government at ensuring that all Nigerian children had quality education. <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230215-WA0028-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66276" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230215-WA0028-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230215-WA0028-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG-20230215-WA0028.jpg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> “Education is critical to national development, and we know that most of these public schools do not have the necessary facilities to aid learning. “So we discovered these gaps and we decided to come in with our intervention. “Especially the out-of-school children, we picked them out of the streets and brought them back to school because we want to ensure that no child is left behind. “We will also ensure that our monitoring team continues to monitor the progress of these children, even as we look forward to enrolling more children in the future,” Onoja said. Mr Beedof Abireh, the Project Lead, DOF-SIP, explained that the foundation would continue to reach the unreached and lift the burden off vulnerable persons in the country. “We donated 100 sets of furniture because we carried out the needs assessment in the school and we saw that most of the pupils were sitting on the floor. “We made the donation so that learning can be fun and comfortable for the children. “We also absorbed 20 new out of school children and paid PTA dues for 80 new pupils, totaling 100 pupils, and we paid for two terms for each pupil. “The new enrollees were also given textbooks, exercise books, sandals, uniforms and bags. “We hope to go to other rural communities in the country to ensure that all children in Nigeria get access to quality education,” he said. Mr Mamman Chanchangi, the school’s Headmaster, appreciated the organisation for the donation, adding that the kind gesture would ameliorate the burden on parents.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Celine-Damilola Oyewole/Nyisom Fiyigon Dore
