By Salisu Sani-Idris The Nigerians Unite for Tinubu/Shettima Mandate, a political pressure group, has expressed confidence that the 2023 elections would be a turning point for the ruling APC in the nation’s capital. The Publicity Secretary of the group, Mr Seyi Adesina, said this in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, shortly after some of its key members monitored elections in some polling units across the territory. Adesina also expressed optimism that the ruling party would win the FCT for the first time. “We are very happy with the conduct of the elections in the FCT, and for the reports so far, the ruling All Progressives Congress will change the narratives. “Before now, we thought history will repeat itself as it has been the tradition to defeat the ruling party in the territory. However, the turnout of our members and their determination indicate that we are coasting to victory,” he stated. Adesina urged all supporters of Tinubu/Shettima to be vigilant and remain calm till the finality of the results across the 62 political wards in the territory. The group also commended their supporters and indeed residents of the FCT for coming out enmasse to exercise their civic duties. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by Muhammad Suleiman Tola
