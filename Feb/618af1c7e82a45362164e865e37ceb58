By Sylvester Thompson Junior Chamber International (JCI), a non-profit organisation of young people, have called on Nigerian youths to take responsibility during and after the general elections. The President of the JCI, Mr  Samuel Chinonyerem, made the call while addressing newsmen  in Abuja on Wednesday. He said that youths should also make it a duty to go and get their voter’s card and vote for their preferred candidates. “We pray that government through the security agencies provide an enabling environment for peaceful elections. “Politicians should desist from any act that will bring violence before, during and after the elections. Government of the people will emerge at the end of the 2023 elections,’’ he said. The president said their prayers was predicated on the fact that, the relative peace t enjoyed in the country had been threatened by heightened insecurity. He said that the heightened insecurity which cuts across all regions of the country, needed to stop for the country to experience economic growth. Chinonyerem who further listed the causes of insecurity in the country, identified good governance as key to the solution. He said having the right leadership in place would guarantee good governance and can only be possible if there was peace and security in country. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng) Edited by Joseph Edeh
