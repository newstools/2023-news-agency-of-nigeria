By Salisu Sani-Idris Mrs Rukayyat Atiku, wife of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has enjoined Muslim Women, especially the hijab wearers to always exhibit good conduct wherever they find themselves. Mrs Abubakar gave the advice at a public lecture to mark the 2023 World Hijab and World Cancer Days organised by the Coalition of Muslim Women, held at the Abuja National Mosque, on Saturday in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the title of the lecture was: ‘Hijab: More than Just a Covering’, delivered by Madeenah Sanni, Founder, Mtalks Life and Marriage Coaching. Atiku said the commemoration of the world hijab day across the globe was a reminder to all the Muslim Women that wearing of hijab was an act of worship. Represented by Sen. Zainab Kure, she said wearing of the hijab had been existent since when Islam started as a religion.   ” Of course, wearing the hijab is not just a necessity but a must. Therefore, the hijab wearers must cultivate and imbibe the culture of Islam. ” Like the title of the lecture say it is beyond adorning in Hijab. It has to do more than wearing the hijab. It has to do more with the behavior of the person wearing the hijab.” Also, the wife of the former Vice President, Mrs Amina Namadi- Sambo, urged Muslim women to realise that wearing of hijab was not just about covering the body, but ensuring good conduct. Represented by Mrs Aisha Bukar-Ali, founder and Coordinator, Diabetic Help Enlightenment Organisation, Namadi-Sambo, reiterated her commitment to continue to support hijab awareness campaign in the country. She said: “A hijab wearer is expected to do everything in accordance with the Islamic injunction and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” On her part, the Coordinator of the coalition, Mrs Rahamah Sani, emphasised the need for all private and public institutions to understand that the use of hijab by the Muslim women was an obligation not a choice. According to her, just like observing five daily prayers and fasting are compulsory, so also the wearing of hijab is mandatory on Muslim women. She added: ” So, if we can be allowed to practice our religion, observe five daily prayers, go for hajj and other religious obligations, why can’t the hijab be accepted? ” And so far you have seen even legal cases against institutions that opposed the use of hijab have been taken to courts and we have won many times. “All we are saying is that, please institutions should accept that wearing of hijab is not a choice, but a religious obligation and we should be allowed to dress the way our creator ordered us to do. ” Because, the right to religion is a fundamental human right and wearing of hijab is part and parcel of our faith and therefore, we should be allowed to dress the way our religion dictate without any form of discrimination.” <img decoding="async" src="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65272" srcset="https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.nannews.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20230204_114347_369-scaled.jpg 837w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the high point of the event was a subsidized cancer screening and sensitisation by the Mission for Education, Social and Health, an NGO, with the theme, ”Cancer Care: the Role of Muslim Community”.
