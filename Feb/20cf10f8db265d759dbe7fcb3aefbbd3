By Stellamaris Ashinze Some experts, on Wednesday, said that renewable energy was key to bridging the energy gap in the underserved and unserved communities. They stated this at a panel discussion, with the theme: ‘Bridging the Energy Gap in Un-served and Under-served Communities in Nigeria’ at the ongoing  AFRICANXT 2023 in Lagos. Founder of Dsuonenegry, Chukwuebuka Obimma, said that more than 70 million people living in rural areas did not have access to electricity supply. He said that the current energy supply gap in Nigeria was, at least, 180,000 MW, according to the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors. ”About 600 million people across Sub-Saharan African communities have no access to electricity. ”A renewable energy will, to a great extent, bridge the gap of un-served and under-served areas,” he said. According to him, there is the need to spend much money in partnering with community leaders because rural areas are an integral part of the society. Chief Operating Officer (COO), Ashdam Solar Co. Ltd., Damilola Asaleye, said that there were misconceptions about solar energy, especially about it being expensive. “Generally, energy is expensive, but the money paid on solar energy can be gotten back within three to five years,” she said. Asaleye stressed the need for sensitisation, education and advocacy on reliable, clean, sustainable and affordable energy. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the ongoing AFRICANXT, scheduled for Feb. 6 to Feb. 10, is with the theme: Cooperate. Collaborate. Innovate. Unlocking Our Potential, Ensuring Africa’s Prosperity.” (NAN) (www.nannews.ng) Edited by ‘Wale Sadeeq
