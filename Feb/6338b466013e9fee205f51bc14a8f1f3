Bala said: “So, if you don’t have the right policy definitely you are going to have difficulties in attaining your goals and objectives and that is why we trained them on how to formulate policies. ” If you look at the content of the presentation on policy formulation it is very rich, comprehensive and garmane. The other aspects is on management. There is going to be a presentation management. “How do you plan, organise, coordinate and also direct or implement the policy direction of the organisation? Then the third aspect is the issue of security because security is a very serious challenge, particularly in the Niger Delta region. ” And for any organisation that is going to operate in the Niger Delta region must be conscious of the security. So it is very important we equip the staff of NDDC on the issues of security challenges. How do you management, prevent the situation that may challenge the security of the region.” Also, a Deputy Director at NDDC, Mr Chris Ekah, affirmed that the training was designed, among others, to equip the staffers with the relevant knowledge on policy making and assist them on how to deliver on the mandate of the NDDC. “The second aspect of the training is on security management. As you are aware Niger Delta is a very volatile area unlike Abuja here, so we are training our staffers to be very mindful of the environment. ”It also focuses on how to guard themselves in the area as well as safeguard our information in terms of our work tools, information flow within the system and the commission,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the participants, an Assistant Manager, Abuja Liaison Office of the commission, Mr Utin Archibong, said the training had been very incisive, educating and it brought to fore what policy formulation in context should look like. He said: “It simply means that our policy should be more domesticated here, within our environment, the Niger Delta region and the country at large. ”And that it should be more inclusive because when we have a lots of inclusiveness, the outcome will be much more better than we see now.” (NAN) ( www.nannews.ng) Edited by Bashir Rabe Mani
