By Thompson Yamput UN’s Long Term Observers on Friday appealed to the Kogi chapter of the NUJ for strong collaboration in the coverage of the 2023 general elections. The observers, Mr Nuno Simoes, (Poland) and Ms Veronica Homolova (Czech Republic) made the appeal during a courtesy visit to the NUJ Chairman, Mr Adeiza Jimoh, in Lokoja Simoes told the NUJ chairman that the duo were in Kogi on the invitation of INEC as observers of the Feb. 25 and March 11 elections. He said they would need the cooperation of journalists in Kogi to succeed in the task as more members of the team would join them to observe the elections in carious wards. He said the team hoped that politicians and the electorate would conduct themselves peacefully and orderly for hitch-free elections. He sought to know about problems encountered by journalists in the discharge of their duties and the behavioural pattern of political parties during electioneering campaigns. Responding, Jimoh expressed delight at the visit, which he said showed the level of importance the UN attached to the role of journalists in elections reportage. “As journalists we disseminate news, especially the manifestoes of political parties, capabilities of their candidates and the need for peaceful electioneering campaigns. “Here in Kogi, there are no threats and we are equally doing our best in the area of investigative journalism. “We organise media parleys with candidates to examine their plans to improve the quality and standard of lives of the electorate,’’ he said. Jimoh said that journalists in Kogi were ready to cover the elections, as “we have been able to complete our on-line media accreditation at INEC and are waiting to collect the kits,’’ He assured of the preparedness of journalists in Kogi to build synergy with the observers for the effective and efficient coverage of the elections.
